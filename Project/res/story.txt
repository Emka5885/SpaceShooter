A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,
Humans and aliens lived together in harmony.
However, one day they quarreled a lot,
Because of which a great battle began.
Although the aliens had a bigger army than humans,
They did not have the greatest warrior of all time.
Although he did not belong to the human species,
He believed they were right in the dispute,
Which made him defend them at all costs.
However, now there were some complications,
Which makes it necessary for you to help him fight.
To move the ship use WSDA, to shoot press space.
Try to shoot down as many enemy ships as possible.
Also, don't let the aliens destroy your ship,
It has a certain stamina, which you constantly control.
